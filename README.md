# Resume Extractor

A simple and efficient **Python CLI tool** that extracts key information from resumes using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **spaCy**.

## How to Use It

Getting this up and running is straightforward.

### 1️. Set Up Your Environment

It’s best to use a **Python virtual environment (venv)** to keep dependencies tidy.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
```

```bash
Copy code
# Activate it (on Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
Copy code
# Or on Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
### **2️. Install Dependencies**
All required libraries are listed in requirements.txt. Install them with:

```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️. Download the spaCy Language Model**
The script relies on spaCy’s pre-trained English language model. Download it by running:

```bash
Copy code
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### **4️. Run the Script**
Once everything is installed, just run the main file:

```bash
Copy code
python resume_extractor.py
```
From there, the script will greet you and give you three choices:

Upload a PDF resume — Enter the file path to your PDF.

Paste resume text — Paste your text directly into the terminal.
(When done, type END on a new, empty line and press Enter.)

Exit — Quit the program.
